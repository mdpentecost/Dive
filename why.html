        <h1>Why Dive?</h1>
                <p>As someone who has struggled with mental health, I have found solace and comfort in music, particularly songs that speak to my emotions and experiences. That's why I am passionate about creating a platform that helps others find songs that resonate with them on a deeper level. Though this is a very basic and small version of Dive, I eventually hope to expand and allow users to sign in or sign up. From there, users would be able to attach their own analysis of songs of their choosing. Having an entire platform filled with several people's interpretations of songs; it is my goal and hope that someone can finally feel seen, heard, and understood.
                    <br> <br>
                    Overall, my goal is to create a platform that helps people to find music that speaks to them on a personal level and provides them with a sense of comfort and understanding. Through Dive, I hope to make a positive impact on the lives of others and contribute to a larger conversation about the power of music in promoting mental health and well-being. Dive on in!
